#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Current version =
 * Compile an OpenCL Program
  * Finish to add C99 extensions (__local, ...)
  * Add attribute qualifiers (binded to empty string for compilation)
  * OpenCL Preprocessor directives
  * Buitin types (scalar types like float4)
  * Conversions and type casting
  * Mock all the builtin functions
   * Work-item functions
   * Math functions
   * Integer functions
   * Common functions
   * Geometric functions
   * Relational Functions
   * Vector data load and store functions
   * Image read and write functions
   * Synchronizations functions
   * Explicit memory fence functions
   * Async copies from Global to Local Memory, Local to Global Memoryn abd Prefetch
 * Better error handling
 * User can use its STL containers with openclam algorithms
  * openclam::for_each
  * openclam::reduce
  * kernels are unary or binary functions?
 * Packaging
  * Release version 1.0
  * Add documentation (examples, API)
  * Tests on different plateforms (ATI vs NVIDIA) + different drivers

= Future versions =
 * Use TBB as alternative CPU implementation (if neither CPU nor GPU devices or plateforms are present)
  * implement all the builtin functions (with boost::math?)
 * Use STL algorithms if TBB is disabled
 * Add Image type support
